                     **Exercise 1: Declare and Initialize Variables**

Write a Go program that declares and initializes variables of various data types
 (int, float64, string, boolean) and prints their values.


                     **Exercise 2: Swapping Variables**
Create a Go program that swaps the values of two integer variables without using a temporary variable.



                     **Exercise 3: User Input and Arithmetic**

Write a Go program that takes two integer inputs from the user, performs
 arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), and prints the results.
                     
                     
                     **Exercise 4: Constants**

Declare a constant in Go to represent the value of pi (3.14159265), and use
it to calculate the circumference of a circle with a given radius.
                     
                     
                     **Exercise 5: Temperature Conversion**

Develop a program that converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit. Declare a variable
 for the Celsius temperature, convert it to Fahrenheit, and print the result.
     
     
                     **Exercise 6: Area of a Rectangle**

Create a Go program that calculates the area of a rectangle. Declare variables for
 the length and width, and then compute and print the area.
                     
                     
                     **Exercise 7: Age in Dog Years**

Write a Go program that takes a user's age as input and calculates and prints their age in dog years
 (multiply the age by 7).
